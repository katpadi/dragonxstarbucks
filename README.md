# DxS: The Coffee Slayer
A clone of a clone (cloneception?): A clone of the game Heavy Bird which is a clone of the widely-popular game Flappy Bird. The only difference is that it doesn't score up when you get pass a tower. It scores++ when you collect Starbucks drinks. Oh, and it uses a dragon instead of bird.

P.S.
It also shakes when you score up so good luck!

## Kat's Notes
* I should be able to distribute Starbucks drinks better.

## Note
This was only tested on an iPhone 5. Expect it to hilariously fail on other devices.
